### **Executor Service**:
An Executor Service uses a Thread Pool to execute tasks in parallel and a Waiting Queue to hold tasks waiting to be executed. 

### **Callable**:
A Callable is similar to a Runnable, but can return a value and is a generic type. To retrieve the return value from a thread, we submit the Executor Service to a Future object.
