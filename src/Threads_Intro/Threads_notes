source code => executable code => process
source code or executable code lives on hard-disk.
Program :
1. Hard-disk
2. Passive (cannot do anything by itself or cannot produce action).
3. CPU is not giving its cycles to program.

Process :
1. RAM
2. Active
3. CPU is executing the process.

Q: Where does process lives?
process lives on RAM.


Process : lives in RAM
3 steps
1.Process Control Block :
    pid,
    list of files opened by process
    Memory limit
    COPY OF REGISTERS
2.Process Paging Table
    virtual memory
3.Process Address Space
    code of memory
    stack
    heap

CPU :
CPU consists of registers
Based on architecture the registers count increases (20 - 40 registers)
Program Counter is the important register.

What does program counter contain?
Program counter contains address of next instruction.

CPU scheduling : CPU scheduling is a process by which the operating system switches the CPU's
attention between different running processes in the RAM. The CPU executes instructions from
one process at a time, and then moves on to the next process. This happens quickly and repeatedly,
giving the impression that all processes are running simultaneously.
However, in reality, the CPU is constantly moving and shuffling between processes to execute their
instructions in a timely manner.

Context Switch : When switching from process P2 to P1, the CPU sends register values to the PCB
of P1, and fetches register values for the PCB of P2.


Threads :

In computer programming, a thread is a unit of execution within a process.
A process is a self-contained unit of execution with its own memory space.
Within a process, multiple threads can run concurrently.
Threads within the same process share resources like memory, but each thread has its own
program counter, registers, and stack.

Example :
Take Google Chrome, for example. When it downloads and allows UI interaction simultaneously, it
likely involves multiple threads. One thread could handle the download operation, while another
manages the user interface. This enables users to interact with the browser without being blocked
by the download process.

Multithreading is a technique used to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications.
By executing multiple threads concurrently, tasks can be performed in parallel. This makes
better use of modern multi-core processors and provides a more responsive user experience.


CPU executes thread in a process.

✶✶✶✶✶     Code for creating threads:       ✶✶✶✶✶

1. Identify the tasks that you want to execute concurrently.
2. Create a new class that implements the Runnable interface.
3. Override the run() method in the new class.
4. Write the logic for the concurrent work or task in the run() method.
5. Create an object of the new class.
6. Create a thread using the object.
7. Start the thread using the start() method.
