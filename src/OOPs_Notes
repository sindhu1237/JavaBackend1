Encapsulation :
1. Binding of data and behaviour i.e ;store all attr and behaviour of an idea together. (using class)
2. Protect the data from illegitimate access. (achieved using Access modifier)

Class :
1. represents structure of an idea.
2. not a real entity but an idea

Object :
1.real instance of a class.
2. each object is totally isolated from other objects.
3. occupies memory

Constructor :

In Java, no object can be created without constructor.
We always need a constructor
If we dont add any constructor java will add a default constructor.
constructor initialises but setter assigns.
â˜…â˜…ðŸ”­If we want to create objects with Specific values and pass them while creating objects we will create
parameterised Constructors

Student s = new Student();
Student --> className
s --> reference variable in stack
new --> asking constructor to create new object
Student() --> constructor in heap

Types of Constructor :
1. Default constructor
2. No arguments constructor
3. custom/ Arguments / Parameterised constructor
4. copy constructor

Default Constructor :
If we dont add any constructor to the class java will add a default constructor (internally /not visible to our eyes)
If we add any constructor java will not add default constructor.
Initialises all attributes to default values.

No Args Constructor :
A constructor created by developer, which does not take any input/parameters/arguments and might intialise the
attributes to default values or something else

custom/ Arguments / Parameterised constructor :
A constructor created by developer, which takes a set of values as attributes/parameters and use these values to intialise
the attributes of the object that it is creating.


SHALLOW COPY :
Only new reference variable is created, pointing to the same old object

DEEP COPY :
Both reference variable  & Object are created new, but object has same attribute values as older
object.

Package : Folder of Classes
getter/setter methods public : door to access the attributes.
Access Modifiers :

Inheritance :
Ability to copy attributes & behaviors from a parent class to child class is called inheritance


upcasting : child object being refered by a parent type
            referee variable (implicit)
            ex : Animal A = new Dog();
downcasting : parent object being refered by a child type
              referee variable (explicit)
              Dog D= new Animal();


Method Overloading :
Same method name but different parameters.
overloading happens in same class.

Method Overiding :
Child class having the same method signature(parent), but different logic in child class


Object in memory :
2 types
1. Primitive variables or value types
2. Reference variables
3. Strings

Primitive variables :
byte, short, int, long => default value is 0.
char => \u000 => empty space
float, double => 0.0
boolean => false
Different default values for each primitive variable.

1. Value types/ primitive variables are stored in stack
2. Local variables are not initialized to default values.
3. Class level/ instance level variables are initialized with default values.

Reference Variable :
Object stored in heap, and address stored in stack.
Default value is null.

Java is always "call by value" or "pass by value".
Variable type => primitive => values were passed to function.
Variable type => Refernce => address => called by value, passed the address of object.

How object attributes are initialized inside constructor ?
1.Creates an object with all default values.
2. Executes the code line by line inside a constructor.
